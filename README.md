# Posts Web Scraper

This project is designed to scrape posts from various websites, store the scraped data in an SQLite database, and send
the collected data to specified destinations via APIs.

The project utilizes Python libraries such as [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io) for making
HTTP requests, [BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4) for parsing
HTML content, and [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) for database management.
